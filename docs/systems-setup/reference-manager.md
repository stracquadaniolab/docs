# Reference manager

We use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) as the standard reference manager for
the lab. It is open source, it exports in BibTex and can be used across MacOS,
Linux and iOS. 

## Install Zotero

Go to the [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) homepage and download the executable
for your machine. 

## Papers storage and synchronization 

Zotero comes with a very limited amount of space, but it allows to store and
synchronize papers across devices using a `WebDav` server. At this time, the
best option is to create a [pCloud](pcloud.com) account, a cloud service that
gives you up to `10Gb` for free and supports WebDav.

To store your papers in pCloud follow these steps: 

1. Go to `Preferences > Sync`. 
2. Tick the option `Sync attachment files in my library using: `  and select WebDav.
3. Finally set the WebDav parameters as follows: 
    - URL: `ewebdav.pcloud.com` and `https` protocol.
    - Username: `<your-pcloud-username>`
    - Password: `<your-pcloud-password>`
4. Click `Verify server`

Your papers are now stored and synchronized with `pCloud`.
